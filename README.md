# Aeroe Wallet
Aeroe Wallet is your go-to tool for managing and mining on Nockchain, offering a straightforward and effective way to engage with the Nockchain ecosystem.

## Development

```
# prerequisites
- rust
- yarn

# install dependencies
yarn

# install nockchain
./scripts/prepare_nockchain.sh

# run dev with browser console
yarn tauri dev

# run dev that is optimized for performance but doesn't have the browser console
yarn tauri dev --release

# build
yarn tauri build
```

## Project Structure

- VENDOR_COMMIT
  - git commit hash of the vendored nockchain repo
  - this isn't really used for development, mainly only used for ci, but you can use it to make sure you're using the correct version of the nockchain repo
- src: svelte frontend
  - lib: shared code, components and javascript libraries
    - components: svelte components
    - scripts/stores.js: svelte stores, used for global state management
    - scripts/wallet-commands.js: command api for interacting with tauri, should probably be renamed to something more general
    - scripts/mock-data.js: legacy code, used for mocking data for the frontend
  - routes: svelte pages
    - (landing): this is basically just the root page `/`, the `()` in the folder name is so that we can scope the `+layout.svelte` file to this route
    - wallet: this is the main wallet page, has a navbar and content area
    - mining: mining page, contains nothing for now
    - explorer: explorer page, contains nothing for now
- src-tauri: backend code, rust and tauri configuration files
  - main.rs: entrypoint but only used for logging and calling lib.rs
  - lib.rs: actual tauri entrypoint, initializes all the tauri state, commands, and plugins
  - commands/*: tauri commands, these are the functions that are called from the frontend
  - keycrypt.rs: encryption for seedphrases with a local password
  - manager.rs: contains the core wallet struct and nockapp interface, will eventually include managing the nockchain node
  - thread_utils.rs: respawnable threads (will eventually need refactoring)
  - wallet_thread.rs: wallet thread (will eventually need refactoring)
  - watcher.rs: watches for aeroe's process, and deletes sensitive data if it crashes or is killed
  - watcher: the actual watcher binary, although it being here is temporary, will eventually be generated by the build process
  - wallet_app.rs: does wallet stuff, will eventually be refactored into manager.rs
- static: static files
- scripts: shell scripts that help with the dev and build process
